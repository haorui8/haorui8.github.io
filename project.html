<h1>Is Obesity Correlated with Happiness? </h1>

<div class="wrap"> 

<p>Obesity is becoming more prevalent through time and this could be a problem for England in the future. Obesity can cause physical and mental health issues which could impact happiness. In the UK, the number of obese people is increasing exponentially, depicted by Figure 1. </p>

<div class="links">
<div id="Chart1"> </div>
</div> 
<h3>Figure 1</h3> 

<p>When the contributing factor of the admission is obesity, it is a primary admission and a secondary admission is when obesity is not necessarily the contributing factor but relevant to a patient's episode of care. Figure 2 shows the direct correlation between obesity and happiness. </p>

<div class="links">
<div id="Chart2"> </div>
</div>
<h3>Figure 2</h3>

<p>The data is sourced from NHS digital and WHO. I combined two datasets onto a single graph and regressed happiness rating to the number of obese persons. The result was a weak positive correlation between happiness and obesity. This approach of exploring the relationship between obesity and happiness is not accurate because the happiness index is the mean of all people living in an area and the ratio of obese people to the entire population of the area is not considered. Furthermore, obesity is not the only factor that effects happiness so other factors were taken into account in the Figure 2 regression. We do not have enough evidence to conclude there is a slight positive correlation between happiness and obesity in England.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am going to approach the question in a different way, by first, observing how two economic factors - unemployment and income correlate with happiness, then observe how the two factors correlate with obesity in the UK. Below are maps of the UK, divided into districts that show the prevalence of these factors.</p>

<h3>Figure 3</h3>

<p>Average happiness is generally lower in the South East, London and West Midland areas. It is also low in some areas in the East. People living South West from London are generally happier.</p>

<div class="links">
<div id="Chart4"> </div>
</div>
<h3>Figure 4</h3>

<p>Gross disposable income is the highest in London. It is relatively in the central east regions of England. </p>

<div class="links">
<div id="Chart5"> </div>
</div>
<h3>Figure 5</h3>

<p>Certain areas specifically concentrated with higher proportion of unemployment benefit claimants. London is one of the areas.</p>

<div class="links">
<div id="Chart6"> </div>
</div>
<h3>Figure 6</h3>

<p>Obesity is especially prevalent in London and the north of England.</p>
<p>After making summarised comments about what the data shows, I hypothesis that gross disposable income and unemployment is negatively correlated with happiness but is positively correlated with obesity. I will now directly regress disposable income and unemployment with happiness and obesity to see if my hypotheses are correct.</p>

<h3>Figure 7</h3>

<p>1) I first regress the average rating of happiness of each district to the proportion of its population claiming unemployment benefits and have found a negative correlation. The regression line shows in general a district will be happier when there is less unemployment. Unemployed individuals could feel devastated because their income will be low and they could feel a lack of purpose in their life.
2) By regressing the average happiness of districts to its respective gross disposable household income per head, I found a mild positive correlation. The more gross disposable income someone has, the happier they will be. This also makes intuitive sense because when someone has a lot of disposable income they can consume more luxury goods and services which will increase their well-being and therefore happiness.</p>

<p>Now I will substitute happiness with obesity and see the correlation obesity has with income and unemployment. It is intuitive to assume obesity negatively correlates with happiness, so this would be true if only one factor out of unemployment and income negatively correlates with obesity.</p>

</div>
<h3>Figure 8</h3>

<p>From Figure 8, we can see that areas with more obese people generally have higher proportions of unemployment claimants so there is a positive correlation between obesity and unemployment.</p>
<p>The chart on the right shows a regression line that is almost vertical, but slightly tilted to the left. Meaning there is a slight, negative correlation between obesity and income.</p>
<p>The last pair of regressions give us some evidence that obesity and happiness are negatively correlated; non-obese people are more likely to be happy.</p>
<p>Challenges: I had trouble combining all 4 datasets into one csv file. I had to learn various excel commands such as deleting and replacing blank spaces, filter the data into a desirable order and manually aligning the data together.</p>
<p>Evaluation: 1) Figure 1 regresses the mean happiness of districts on the number of obese people, instead of the proportion of obese people. Population is different between districts so proportion of obese people would be a better determinant of the impact obesity is causing in that district.</p> <p> 2) Only a portion of districts had data on happiness rating, obesity admissions, unemployment claimant and disposable household income so the regressions do not provide an exact representation of England.</p>
