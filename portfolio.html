        <h1>Week 1</h1>
        <h3>Korea's Population Structure</h3>
        <p>The first chart shows Korea's rapid aging population.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>

        <h3>Korea's Covid Deaths</h3>
        <p>My second chart looks the deaths caused by Covid-19 in Korea</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart2"> </div>

        <h1>Week 2</h1>
        <h3>IMF Lending Outstanding uncleaned</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart3"> </div>

        <h3>IMF Lending Outstanding cleaned</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart4"> </div>
        <p>1984 was the most risky year for the IMF because their lending was equivalent to 0.31% of the world's GDP, the peak in the graph.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="myWeek3"> 

        <h1>Week 3</h1>
        <h3>Sterling to Dollar Exchange Rate</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart5"> </div>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart6"> </div>
        <p>Because of the huge number of data points, my encoding field types for date and exchange rate has to be temporal and quantitative respectively. I found that using a line chart (second graph) for a large quantity of data visualises it more clearly than a bar chart (first graph) because our attention doesn't become distracted by the mass occupation of space that a line chart wouldn't do. </p>

    <div class="myWeek4"> 
        <h1>Week 4</h1>
        <h3>Scraping UK Population Demographic</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart7"> </div>
        <p>I chose to scrape from Wikipedia because they have a lot of data on the UK population. Eventually, I chose to scrape data on UK's age demographic.</p>
